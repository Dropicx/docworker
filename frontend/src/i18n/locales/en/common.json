        "question": "Where is my data processed and how secure is it?",
        "answer": "HealthLingo is hosted on Railway.app, a SOC 2 Type I certified provider with full GDPR compliance. Servers are located in the EU and Railway offers a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) per GDPR Article 28. AI processing is done via OVH AI Endpoints in European data centers (ISO 27001, 27017, 27018, 27701 certified). OVH guarantees that your data is NEVER used for AI model training - all requests are anonymized and deleted immediately after processing."
      },
      "1": {
        "question": "Is my medical data stored or used for AI training?",
        "answer": "No, absolutely not. HealthLingo does not permanently store any data. OVH AI Endpoints has a strict no-training policy: customer data is never stored or used for model training. After translation, all documents, texts and personal information are automatically and irreversibly deleted. The AI models do NOT learn from your data - each request is isolated and leaves no trace."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "How long does the translation take?",
        "answer": "Most documents are translated within 10-30 seconds. The exact duration depends on the length and complexity of the document. Scanned documents may take slightly longer as they first need to be processed via OCR (text recognition)."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "Which file formats are supported?",
        "answer": "HealthLingo supports PDF files (both with embedded text and scanned documents) as well as image files (JPG, PNG, JPEG). The maximum file size is 10 MB. Multi-page documents are fully processed."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "Which languages can be translated to?",
        "answer": "In addition to simplification into understandable German, we support translations into 19 carefully selected languages optimally supported by {{model}}: English, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hindi, Polish, Czech, Swedish, Norwegian and Danish. Translation always follows a two-step process: first simplification, then precise translation."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "What happens to personal data in the document?",
        "answer": "Personal data such as names, addresses, dates of birth and insurance numbers are automatically detected and replaced with placeholders (e.g. [NAME REMOVED]). This protects your privacy while all medical information is fully preserved. Anonymization happens locally before data is sent to the AI endpoints."
      },
      "6": {
        "question": "What security certifications do the services used have?",
        "answer": "Railway.app is SOC 2 Type I certified (Type II following in 2025) and offers GDPR-compliant Data Processing Agreements. OVH Cloud holds comprehensive certifications: ISO/IEC 27001 (information security), ISO/IEC 27017 (cloud security), ISO/IEC 27018 (privacy in the cloud) and ISO/IEC 27701 (privacy management). Both providers are subject to European law and guarantee that your data does not leave the EU."
      },
      "7": {
        "question": "Is the translation medically accurate?",
        "answer": "HealthLingo uses advanced AI technology specifically trained for medical texts. The translations are very precise but do not replace professional medical advice. For important medical decisions, you should always consult your doctor."
      },
      "8": {
        "question": "Can I download the translation?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can download the translated version as a PDF file. The PDF contains the complete translation in a readable format with date and timestamp. You can also copy the text directly to the clipboard."
      },
      "9": {
        "question": "Does HealthLingo work with scanned documents?",
        "answer": "Yes! HealthLingo has advanced text recognition (OCR) with special optimization for German medical documents. Even handwritten notes, tables and poorly scanned documents are reliably recognized and processed."
      },
      "10": {
        "question": "Is the service really free?",
        "answer": "Yes, HealthLingo is completely free to use. There are no hidden costs, no registration and no limit on the number of translations. Our goal is to make medical information accessible to everyone."
