      "0": {
        "question": "Where is my data processed and how secure is it?",
        "answer": "Your documents are processed predominantly on secure servers in Europe (Germany and France). For security and network services, we use Cloudflare (USA), secured by EU Standard Contractual Clauses and the EU-US Data Privacy Framework. All our partners have signed GDPR-compliant data protection agreements."
      },
      "1": {
        "question": "Is my medical data stored or used for AI training?",
        "answer": "No, absolutely not. HealthLingo does not permanently store any data. Your documents are automatically deleted after translation. The AI does NOT learn from your data - each request is processed separately and leaves no trace."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "How long does the translation take?",
        "answer": "Most documents are translated within 10-30 seconds. The exact duration depends on the length and complexity of your document. Scanned or photographed documents may take slightly longer as the text needs to be recognized first."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "Which file formats are supported?",
        "answer": "You can upload PDF files and images. Common image formats like JPEG, PNG and similar are supported. The maximum file size is 100 MB. Multi-page documents are fully processed."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "Which languages can be translated to?",
        "answer": "In addition to simplification into understandable German, we offer translations into 19 other languages, including: English, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hindi, Polish, Czech, Swedish, Norwegian and Danish. Translation happens in two steps: first the text is simplified, then translated into your chosen language."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "What happens to personal data in the document?",
        "answer": "Personal data such as names, addresses, dates of birth and insurance numbers are automatically detected and replaced with placeholders. IMPORTANT: This automatic detection works very well but cannot always find all data. We therefore recommend blacking out particularly sensitive data yourself before uploading."
      },
      "6": {
        "question": "How is my data technically protected?",
        "answer": "All data is encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM – the current state-of-the-art in data security. All transmissions use secure HTTPS/TLS connections. HealthLingo uses no marketing or tracking cookies, only strictly necessary cookies for language settings. Document processing takes place predominantly in the EU (Germany, France), with network security via Cloudflare (USA, secured by SCCs)."
      },
      "7": {
        "question": "Is the translation medically accurate?",
        "answer": "IMPORTANT: The translations are NOT medical advice and do not replace a conversation with your doctor. HealthLingo does not make diagnoses or give treatment recommendations. The translations only help you understand your documents better. For medical questions, always consult your doctor. In emergencies, call emergency services immediately."
      },
      "8": {
        "question": "Can I download the translation?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can download the translated version as a PDF file. The PDF contains the complete translation in an easy-to-read format with date and time. You can also copy the text directly."
      },
      "9": {
        "question": "Does HealthLingo work with scanned documents?",
        "answer": "Yes! HealthLingo can recognize text from scanned documents and photos. Even handwritten notes, tables and hard-to-read documents are processed reliably. The text recognition is specially optimized for German medical documents."
      },
      "10": {
        "question": "Is the service really free?",
